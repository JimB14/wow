                            Women of Worship (WoW) started in Nairobi, Kenya in 2007 under the leadership of Damaris Mkubwa in Assemblies of Christ Church where her husband, 
                            Emmanuel Mkubwa, was the Senior Pastor. There was a need to reach out to ladies who were not in church and were struggling with drugs, addictions, 
                            prostitution, domestic abuse, sex trafficking, and mental illness among others. The focus was to equip these women to become great leaders who will 
                            influence the community around them. The class started with a few women from church who had their own struggles as well. Shortly after, many women 
                            from the streets started joining the class and the ministry was born.
                            <br><br>
                            In, December, 2013, WoW was introduced in Kabale, Uganda. In July 2014, God opened a door of opportunity in Minnesota, USA and WoW began monthly meetings. 
                            Pastor David Modder, the Senior Pastor of Seward Church opened his church doors for the monthly meetings to take place. Thus far, the Lord has brought this 
                            ministry and we are excited about what He is going to do because the work has just began. We believe that this movement will spread to all parts of the world.
                            <br><br>
                            We are also calling all women who are already in church and know Jesus as the Lord of their life to join us in reaching these women that are outside church walls, 
                            especially our young daughters that need to be guided in the truth. The book of Titus talks to older women to train the young women in the ways of the Lord. 
                            Old does not necessary mean old in age but it can also mean spiritually mature. May the Lord raise mothers like Deborah who will be role models to other women. 
                            If you feel the call to join us, please go ahead and write to us and we will get back to you. We need more laborers for the harvest is ready. Luke 10:2 says, 
                            &quot;Then He said to them, &#39;The harvest truly is great, but the laborers are few; therefore pray the Lord of the harvest to send out laborers into His 
                            harvest.&#39;&quot;
