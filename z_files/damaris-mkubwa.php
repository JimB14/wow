                        Women of Worship â€“- WoW -- is a ministry of Solace Ministries International. This ministry was birthed as a result of some addictions that Damaris went 
                        through.  When she was a young lady, she was introduced to pornography by her high school friends that lead to strong addictions to sex, masturbation, 
                        and lust. She struggled with these addictions for years even after she gave her life to Christ. She met her lovely husband Pastor Emmanuel Mkubwa, and 
                        got married in 2006. However, she still kept the secret from him and he later became the lead pastor at one of the local churches his father, Bishop 
                        Samuel Mkubwa, planted in Nairobi, Kenya. 
                        <br><br>
                        After two years of marriage while still struggling in secret, Damaris decided to break the silence to her husband regarding the strongholds that hindered 
                        her from worshiping God in liberty. After she confessed, her husband encouraged her that everything works together for good to those that believe as stated 
                        in the Bible (Romans 8:28). She experienced complete freedom and God continued to raise her up and use her powerfully. 
                        <br><br>
                        As a result, Women of Worship (WoW) was born. Through worship, as her husband is a worshiper, Damaris was set free and 
                        started meetings in Kenya to reach out to women in church struggling with secret sins as well as women out there who could not come to church because 
                        of fear of being judged by Christians. These meetings expanded and currently, we host Women of Worship Annual Conference in Kenya every December 
                        just to empower women to rise up from any kind of bondage through the Precious Blood of Jesus Christ. 
                        <br><br>
                        In December 2011, God called Damaris and her family to the United States of America. In 2012, Damaris continued with Women of Worship conferences in Kenya 
                        where she travels for the meetings. Upon her return to USA from her missions in 2013, God laid on Damaris&#39;s heart to start Women of Worship in USA where 
                        there was a great demand. 
                        <br><br>
                        She mobilized a few women and started praying together every Monday on a conference call. After one and a half years of prayer, intercession, and fellowship, Women 
                        of Worship USA was launched on Saturday, July 26, 2014 in Minneapolis, MN. 
                        <br><br>
                        Thus far, it has been by God&#39;s faithfulness. We are pressing forward as women to see every woman live in total victory and freedom. This ministry has made a great 
                        impact as women have been set free from tormenting demons. We believe there is a lot of work out there and we need more people like you and I that have a passion for 
                        the lost to stand and unite in this movement.
                        <br><br>
                        Our desire is to see the addicts, abused, strippers, sick, mentally disturbed, prisoners, etc being transformed to be leaders who are worshipers of Jesus Christ all 
                        over the world. 
                        <br><br>
                        Thank you all for your support and God bless!
